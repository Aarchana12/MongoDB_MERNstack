# Online Complaint Registration and Management System

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Online Complaint Registration and Management System** is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of raising and resolving complaints. It allows users to register complaints, track their status, and ensure they are handled efficiently. Admins can manage agents and assign complaints to them, while agents log in to resolve the complaints.

## ✨ Features

### User:
- **Register/Login** to submit complaints.
- **Raise complaints** with details and categorize them.
- **Track the status** of complaints from submission to resolution.
- Receive **notifications** when complaint status is updated.

### Admin:
- **Create and manage agents** to handle complaints.
- **Assign complaints** to agents for resolution.
- Monitor and manage all **complaint statuses**.
- **View reports** on system performance and complaint resolution times.

### Agent:
- **Login** to view assigned complaints.
- **Resolve complaints** by updating the status.
- Provide **feedback on resolved issues**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
This project is built using the **MERN** stack:
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL database)
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **State Management**: Redux (optional)
- **Deployment**: (add your deployment platform, e.g., Heroku, AWS)

## 🖼️ System Architecture
The system follows a client-server architecture, with a **React.js** frontend, **Node.js/Express.js** backend, and **MongoDB** database for data storage. Users interact with the frontend, which communicates with the backend via REST APIs. The backend handles complaint management and assigns complaints to agents. Admins can manage users, agents, and complaints through a dedicated dashboard.
